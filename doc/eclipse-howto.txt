== Windows ==

 1. Install "GNU Toolchain for ARM Processros"
 2. Install "GNU Make" for Windows
 3. Install the Java JRE from Oracle.
 4. Download "Eclipse for C++ Developers".
 5. Extract the Eclipse archive downloaded to your Downloads folder.
 6. Get the "YARD-ICE" source code from GitHub.
 7. Install the "STM32 ST-LINK Utility" from STMicroelectronics


=== GNU Toolchain for ARM Processros ===

Download and install the GNU toolchain for ARM processros:

https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded
https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2015-q1-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q1-20150306-win32.exe
https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2015-q2-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q2-20150609-win32.exe

During the installation process .
Use the default values suggested by the wizard installer.
In the last screen, after the files were copyed, select the "Add path to environment variable" option. 


=== GNU Make for Windows ===

Download and install GNU Make:

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
Tip: Install on the same folder as the GCC so you won't need to modify your path. During the installation in the "Select Destination Location:" page enter:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\4.9 2015q1" in the text box.
Also there is no point of creating a "Start Menu" folder. Disable this option by uncheckintg the "Don't create a Start Menu folder" in the page: "Select Start Menu Folder". 

=== Java Runtime Environement (JRE) ===

Eclipse depends on a Java so a Java Runtime Environment must be installed in your system.

==== Do I have Java in my system ? ====

The easy way to check whether you have the JRE installed in your system is to type call the java interpreter from a windows console:
"Start"-->"All Programs"-->"Accessories"-->"Command Prompt"
Type: "java -version"
The output should be something similar to this:

"
java version "1.8.0_40"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_40-b26)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.40-b25, mixed mode)
"

==== Installing the JRE ====

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Most probably the JAva version you want is the 64 bits version for 
Windows hosts:

"Windows x64" --> "jre-8u60-windows-x64.exe"

=== Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers ===

Download and install Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers
https://eclipse.org/downloads/

"eclipse-cpp-mars-R-win32-x86_64.zip"

It simply a matter of downloading the .ZIP (package) file from the website If you have not install any Eclipse package, and unzip the downloaded file into a directory of your choice. 
For example "C:/eclipse"


=== YARD-ICE Source Code ===
