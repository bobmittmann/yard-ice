Download and install the GNU toolchain for ARM processros:

https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded
https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2015-q1-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q1-20150306-win32.exe

Download and install GNU Make:

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
Tip: Install on the same folder as the GCC so you won't need to modify your path. During the installation in the "Select Destination Location:" page enter:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\4.9 2015q1" in the text box.
Also there is no point of creating a "Start Menu" folder. Disable this option by uncheckintg the "Don't create a Start Menu folder" in the page: "Select Start Menu Folder".
