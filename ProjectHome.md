# Welcome to the YARD-ICE project #

The **YARD-ICE** project is a community based, open source platform for a standalone remote debugger.

One goal of the project is to free embedded systems developers from the Windows/PC platform and slow or expensive emulators. If you are a Linux or MAC user you would be able to use the tool out of the _web_. There is no need to install drivers, is all network TCP/IP based.

This is not a software only project, the hardware platform is also provided.
The Hardware design is free and open source, including: schematics, PCB layout and VHDL code.
