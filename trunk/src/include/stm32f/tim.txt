TIM1&TIM8 break and dead-time register (TIMx_BDTR)
Address offset: 0x44
Bit 15 MOE: Main output enable
This bit is cleared asynchronously by hardware as soon as the break input is active. It is set
by software or automatically depending on the AOE bit. It is acting only on the channels
which are configured in output.
0: OC and OCN outputs are disabled or forced to idle state.
1: OC and OCN outputs are enabled if their respective enable bits are set (CCxE, CCxNE in
TIMx_CCER register).
See OC/OCN enable description for more details (Section 13.4.9: TIM1&TIM8
capture/compare enable register (TIMx_CCER) on page 344).
Bit 14 AOE: Automatic output enable
0: MOE can be set only by software
1: MOE can be set by software or automatically at the next update event (if the break input is
not be active)
Note: This bit can not be modified as long as LOCK level 1 has been programmed (LOCK bits
in TIMx_BDTR register).
Bit 13 BKP: Break polarity
0: Break input BRK is active low
1: Break input BRK is active high
Note: This bit can not be modified as long as LOCK level 1 has been programmed (LOCK bits
in TIMx_BDTR register).
Note: Any write operation to this bit takes a delay of 1 APB clock cycle to become effective.
Bit 12 BKE: Break enable
0: Break inputs (BRK and CCS clock failure event) disabled
1; Break inputs (BRK and CCS clock failure event) enabled
Note: This bit cannot be modified when LOCK level 1 has been programmed (LOCK bits in
TIMx_BDTR register).
Note: Any write operation to this bit takes a delay of 1 APB clock cycle to become effective.
Bit 11 OSSR: Off-state selection for Run mode
This bit is used when MOE=1 on channels having a complementary output which are
configured as outputs. OSSR is not implemented if no complementary output is implemented
in the timer.
See OC/OCN enable description for more details (Section 13.4.9: TIM1&TIM8
capture/compare enable register (TIMx_CCER) on page 344).
0: When inactive, OC/OCN outputs are disabled (OC/OCN enable output signal=0).
1: When inactive, OC/OCN outputs are enabled with their inactive level as soon as CCxE=1
or CCxNE=1. Then, OC/OCN enable output signal=1
Note: This bit can not be modified as soon as the LOCK level 2 has been programmed (LOCK
bits in TIMx_BDTR register).
Bit 10 OSSI: Off-state selection for Idle mode
This bit is used when MOE=0 on channels configured as outputs.
See OC/OCN enable description for more details (Section 13.4.9: TIM1&TIM8
capture/compare enable register (TIMx_CCER) on page 344).
0: When inactive, OC/OCN outputs are disabled (OC/OCN enable output signal=0).
1: When inactive, OC/OCN outputs are forced first with their idle level as soon as CCxE=1 or
CCxNE=1. OC/OCN enable output signal=1)
Note: This bit can not be modified as soon as the LOCK level 2 has been programmed (LOCK
bits in TIMx_BDTR register).
Bits 9:8 LOCK[1:0]: Lock configuration
These bits offer a write protection against software errors.
00: LOCK OFF - No bit is write protected.
01: LOCK Level 1 = DTG bits in TIMx_BDTR register, OISx and OISxN bits in TIMx_CR2
register and BKE/BKP/AOE bits in TIMx_BDTR register can no longer be written.
10: LOCK Level 2 = LOCK Level 1 + CC Polarity bits (CCxP/CCxNP bits in TIMx_CCER
register, as long as the related channel is configured in output through the CCxS bits) as well
as OSSR and OSSI bits can no longer be written.
11: LOCK Level 3 = LOCK Level 2 + CC Control bits (OCxM and OCxPE bits in
TIMx_CCMRx registers, as long as the related channel is configured in output through the
CCxS bits) can no longer be written.
Note: The LOCK bits can be written only once after the reset. Once the TIMx_BDTR register
has been written, their content is frozen until the next reset.
Bits 7:0 DTG[7:0]: Dead-time generator setup
This bit-field defines the duration of the dead-time inserted between the complementary
outputs. DT correspond to this duration.
DTG[7:5]=0xx => DT=DTG[7:0]x tdtg with tdtg=tDTS.
DTG[7:5]=10x => DT=(64+DTG[5:0])xtdtg with Tdtg=2xtDTS.
DTG[7:5]=110 => DT=(32+DTG[4:0])xtdtg with Tdtg=8xtDTS.
DTG[7:5]=111 => DT=(32+DTG[4:0])xtdtg with Tdtg=16xtDTS.
Example if TDTS=125ns (8MHz), dead-time possible values are:
0 to 15875 ns by 125 ns steps,
16 us to 31750 ns by 250 ns steps,
32 us to 63us by 1 us steps,
64 us to 126 us by 2 us steps
Note: This bit-field can not be modified as long as LOCK level 1, 2 or 3 has been programmed
(LOCK bits in TIMx_BDTR register).
TIM1&TIM8 repetition counter register (TIMx_RCR)
Address offset: 0x30
Bits 15:8 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.
Bits 7:0 REP[7:0]: Repetition counter value
These bits allow the user to set-up the update rate of the compare registers (i.e. periodic
transfers from preload to active registers) when preload registers are enable, as well as the
update interrupt generation rate, if this interrupt is enable.
Each time the REP_CNT related downcounter reaches zero, an update event is generated
and it restarts counting from REP value. As REP_CNT is reloaded with REP value only at
the repetition update event U_RC, any write to the TIMx_RCR register is not taken in
account until the next repetition update event.
It means in PWM mode (REP+1) corresponds to:
–
the number of PWM periods in edge-aligned mode
–
the number of half PWM period in center-aligned mode.
