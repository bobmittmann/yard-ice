Preamble
========

The preamble is part of the license and the license and its preamble
can not be split out.

Definitions:

SYSTEM
    Is any thing that works or supposed to work to do some 
    operations depending on some specific inputs and produce 
    some results. 

HARDWARE DESIGN: 
    (The terms HARDWARE DESIGN and DESIGN can be used 
    interchangeably in the license) 
    
    Is any work that defines, describes or simulates a system or 
    part of a system that could be physically implemented. This 
    includes but not limited to, system architectures, design 
    ideas, design description, micro-codes or hardware 
    instructions. 

HARDWARE DESIGN DESCRIPTION: 
    (The terms HARDWARE DESIGN DESCRIPTION and DESIGN 
    DESCRIPTION can be used interchangeably in the license) 
    
    Is any form of documentation or supporting materials that 
    defines and identifies the Hardware design, how it can be 
    implemented and/or tested. This includes but not limited to, 
    HDL codes, schematics, net-lists, PCB layouts, chip and 
    silicon cell layout, timing diagrams, truth tables, flow 
    charts, state diagrams, block diagrams or written (digitally 
    or physically) documentation. 

Hardware design files/ CAD files: 
    Are set of files that are used to describe 
    the hardware design, its implementation or testing or some 
    parts of it. 

Fabrication files: 
    Are set of files that are used to physically implement 
    the design or part of it. 

COPYING A HARDWARE DESIGN DESCRIPTION: 
    Is the act of duplicating the design 
    description or CAD files in anyway. 

DISTRIBUTION OF A HARDWARE DESIGN: 
    Is the act of publishing and making the design description 
    available for more activities or people.

MODIFICATION OF A DESIGN: 
    Is the act of reproducing the design in order to alter 
    (not necessarily to succeed to improve) the design itself 
    or the description of the design. 

IMPLEMENTATION OF A DESIGN: 
    Is the act of producing/reproducing the hardware design or 
    part of it to get the physical or part of the physical system. 

The Derivative work 
    means any changes, improvements or porting the original work 
    to other environments or platforms (e.g. different hardware 
    target, different PLD....). This may vary depending on the 
    type of the hardware design itself. 

The based work 
    is the act of using the design AS IS without any modification 
    as a building block or module of other design. (e.g. like using 
    the design as a daughter board for a large system, or using the 
    HDL code in SoC core). 



OpenIPCore/OpenCores License terms.
===================================

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 

1. This license applies to hardware designs, hardware design 
   description, CAD or Fabrication files or any other work which 
   contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may 
   be distributed under the terms of this License. 

2. You may copy, distribute and/or implement this Hardware Design 
   or any portion of it as is. Any time you copy or distribute this 
   design you have to provide all of the source files and 
   documentations that came with the original work or put them in 
   a public place that anyone can reach without any kind of 
   restrictions. 

3. You can not sell the design description, design files or 
   fabrication files but you may charge fee for the physical act 
   of transferring a copy 

4. You can implement the design and charge fees for the physical 
   hardware and you have to provide notice for the public about 
   the source of the design description. 

5. Any modification of this hardware design or any derivative work 
   from it should be documented by providing list of changes, reasons 
   behind the changes and the date of change. 

6. You are allowed to use the design or design files on any work 
   based on the hardware design. 

7. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the design/design 
   description or files except as expressly provided under this License. 
   Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the 
   design/design description or files is void, and will automatically 
   terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have 
   received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not 
   have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
   full compliance. 

8. Each time you redistribute the design description or files, 
   the recipient automatically receives a license from the original 
   licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further 
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted 
   herein. 

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have 
   not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission 
   to modify or distribute the hardware design or its derivative 
   works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
   accept this License. Therefore, by modifying, distributing
   or implementing the hardware design (or any work based on the 
   hardware design), you indicate your acceptance of this License 
   to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
   distributing or modifying the hardware design or works based 
   on it. 

10. NO WARRANTY of any kind is provided on the functionality, 
   performance or risks cased by using this Hardware Design. 


NO WARRANTY
===========

11.a. BECAUSE THE HARDWARE DESIGN IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, 
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR IT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE 
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS 
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE HARDWARE DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION 
"AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, 
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE 
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE HARDWARE DESIGN IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD THE DESIGN PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST 
OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 

11.b. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO 
IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY

INABILITY TO USE THE HARDWARE DESIGN (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES 
SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR ANY OTHER KIND OF LOSSES 
OR A FAILURE OF THE HARDWARE DESIGN IMPLEMENTATION TO OPERATE 
WITH ANY OTHER SYSTEMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY 
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

11.c IN CASE OF THE PHYSICAL IMPLEMINTATION, THE IMPLIMENTER CAN 
PROVIDE WARRANTIES ON THE PHYSICAL HARDWARE AND CHARGE FOR FEES 
FOR SUCH WARRANTIES.
