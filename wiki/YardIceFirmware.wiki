#summary YARD-ICE Firmware Main

= Introduction =

The software of the *YARD-ICE* is split into 3 parts:
  * SDK Libraries (Software Development Kit Libraries)
  * YARD-ICE Libraries (Libraries specific to the application)
  * YARD-ICE Application

== SDK Libraries ==

These are a set of supporting libraries located inside the *src/sdk* directory. Each library can be used independently or compiled as a part of the YARD-ICE firmware.

  * *libaltera* - provides functions for loading program (rbf) files into the attached FPGA. It uses an SPI interface.
  * *libbitvec* - bit vector manipulation functions.
  * *libc* - the YARD libc is a small library targeted to embedded systems.
  * *libcm3* - Cortex-M3 specific functions
  * *libcrc* - Cyclic Redundancy Check functions.
  * *libdrv* - drivers for devices like Ethernet, Serial 
  * *libhexdump* - provides functions to display binary data as hexadecimal plus ASCII values, like the hexdump command.
  * *libice-comm* - library used for real-time trace. This tool will send the trace to a remote host if a tool like the YARD-ICE is connected to the JTAG port.
  * *libopcodes* - this library provides disassembler capabilities to the tool.
  * *libstm32f* - ST stm32f SoC hardware access functions
  * *libtcpip* -  efficient and small footprint TCP/IP stack, designed for embedded systems.
  * *libthinkos* - the ThinkOS real time operating system. This small RTOS was designed and optimized for ARM Cortex-M cores. It provides a very low context switching latency a useful "_interrupt as thread_" mechanism.
  * *libutil* - set of utilities like a calibrated delay.

== Libraries ==

The YARD-ICE firmware do not need any external or third-party library. All what it is need to compile the firmware is provided with the source-code.
