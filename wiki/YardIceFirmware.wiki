#summary YARD-ICE Firmware Main

= Introduction =

The software of the *YARD-ICE* comprises a set of libraries. Each library can be used independently or compiled as a part of the YARD-ICE firmware.

== Libraries ==

The YARD-ICE firmware do not need any external or third-party library. All what it is need to compile the firmware is provided with the source-code.

  * LIBC - the YARD libc is a small library targeted to embedded systems.
  * RTOS - uses the ThinkOS real time operating system. This RTOS was designed and optimized for Cortex-M cores.
  * TCP/IP - small footprint efficient stack designed for embedded systems.
  * CM3 - Cortex-M3 specific functions
  * STM32F - ST stm32f SoC hardware access functions
  * ICE-COMM - library used for real-time trace using a JTAG tool like the YARD-ICE.
