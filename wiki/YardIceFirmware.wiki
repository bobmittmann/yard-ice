#summary YARD-ICE Firmware Main

= Introduction =

The software of the *YARD-ICE* is split into 3 parts:
  * SDK Libraries (Software Development Kit Libraries)
  * YARD-ICE Libraries (Libraries specific to the application)
  * YARD-ICE Application

== SDK Libraries ==

These are a set of supporting libraries. Each library can be used independently or compiled as a part of the YARD-ICE firmware.

  * libc - the YARD libc is a small library targeted to embedded systems.
  * libthinkos - uses the ThinkOS real time operating system. This RTOS was designed and optimized for Cortex-M cores.
  * libtcpip - small footprint efficient stack designed for embedded systems.
  * libcm3 - Cortex-M3 specific functions
  * libstm32f - ST stm32f SoC hardware access functions
  * libice-comm - library used for real-time trace using a JTAG tool like the YARD-ICE.
  * libcrc
  * libutil
  * libaltera


== Libraries ==

The YARD-ICE firmware do not need any external or third-party library. All what it is need to compile the firmware is provided with the source-code.
