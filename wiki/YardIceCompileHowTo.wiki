#summary How To Compile the YARD-ICE Firmware

= Introduction =

The source code is located in the *src* directory. All you need to compile is a working GCC-ARM Toolchain.

== GCC-ARM Toolchain ==

To compile make sure you have the *GCC-ARM toolchain* (arm-none-eabi-*) installed into your host computer.
You can compile it by yourself: [http://bobmittmann.blogspot.ca/2012/02/ubuntu-1004-lts-and-arm-gnu-toolchain.html ARM-GCC Tolchain How-To]
or download a pre-compiled package for your system (Note: someone could write a how-to).

Make sure you have the arm-none-eabi-gcc in your PATH:

{{{
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc
arm-none-eabi-gcc: fatal error: no input files
compilation terminated.
}}}

= The Source Code =

You can get the latest revision source code from the repository:
{{{
svn checkout http://yard-ice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk yard-ice
}}}

= Compiling =

Move inside the *src* directory and type *make*.

{{{
$ cd yard-ice/src
yard-ice/src$ make

}}}

The files will be compiled, by default, into a directory called *release*:
{{{
yard-ice/src$ ls release
libaltera  libcm3  libhexdump   libstm32f   libutil       yard-ice.elf  yard-ice.o
libbitvec  libcrc  libice-comm  libtcpip    version.h     yard-ice.lst  yard-ice.sym
libc       libdrv  libopcodes   libthinkos  yard-ice.bin  yard-ice.map
}}}

The loadable firmware is called: *yard-ice.bin*.

== Make Targets and Options ==

A list of available make targets and options can be obtained by typing *make help* at the *src* directory.

{{{
yard-ice/src$ make help
Targets:

  all        - Build YARD-ICE
  clean      - Remove most generated files
  jtagload   - Build YARD-ICE and try to load it into target

  make V=0|1 [targets] 0 => quiet build (default), 1 => verbose build
  make O=dir [targets] Locate all output files in "dir"
  make D=0|1 [targets] 0 => release (default), 1 => debug
