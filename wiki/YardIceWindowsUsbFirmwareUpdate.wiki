#summary STM32F Firmware Upgrade on Windows

= YARD-ICE Firmware Upgrade =

== Introduction ==

One of the nice features of the STM32 family of microcontrollers is the embedded flash loader. 

ST provides a demo application that can be used to upload the firmware using the USB connection.

== How To Upload ==

  * Download the [http://www.st.com/st-web-ui/static/active/en/st_prod_software_internet/resource/technical/software/demo_and_example/stsw-stm32080.zip DfuSe USB device firmware upgrade STMicroelectronics extension].
  * Decompress the ZIP file:

  * Run the appropriated installer for your platform:
    * 32 bits: DfuSe_Demo_V3.0.3_Setup.exe
    * 64 bits: DfuSe_Demo_V3.0.3_Setup_amd64.exe
  * Disconnect the power and USB from the YARD-ICE
  * Insert the P2 jumper in YARD-ICE board
  * Connect the USB cable
  * Run the {{{STMicroelectronics->DfuSe->DfuSe Demonstration}}}
  https://yard-ice.googlecode.com/files/dfuse-demo-v303.png
  * The DfuSe Demo application should show {{{STM Device in DFU Mode}}} under the {{{Available DFU Devices}}}
  * Under "Upgrade or Veriy Action" press the "Choose..." button
  * Select the *yard-yce.dfu* firmware file. See the next section on how to create the DFU file.
  * Press the Upgrade button

== How To Create a DFU File ==

The ST utility requires the firmware to be packed in a proprietary FDU format. There is one utility provided in the demo that allows to convert the output binary into a FDU file format.
Here is how to do it:
  * Run the {{{STMicroelectronics->DfuSe->DFU File Manager}}}
  http://yard-ice.googlecode.com/files/dfu-want-to.png
  * Select the option {{{I want to GENERATE a DFU file form S19, HEX or BIN files}}}
  http://yard-ice.googlecode.com/files/dfu-file-manager.png
  * Select the button {{{Multi BIN...}}}
  * Select the *yard-ice.bin* binary file from the *src/release* directory.

  * Make sure the address is set to 0x00000000 (default value), press the {{{Add to List>>}}} button and then {{{OK}}} to close this window.
  * Press the {{{Generate...}}} button to create the *yard-ice.dfu* file.
