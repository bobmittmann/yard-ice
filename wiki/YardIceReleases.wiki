#summary Firmware Releases

= Introduction =

This page contains periodic firmware releases binaries.

= YARD-ICE Application =

The application should be loaded at address 0x08000000 of the flash memory.
Hardware revisions 0.1 and 0.2 share the same IO so the same firmware applies. 

  * [https://yard-ice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/release/yard-ice-0.2.22.bin Version 0.2.22]


= FPGA Program =

The FPGA program should be loaded at address 0x08060000 of the flash memory.
There is a difference in the pin assignments between revision 0.1 and 0.2 of the boards. Each board revision have it's own binary (RBF) program.

== Hardware 0.1 ==
  * [https://yard-ice.googlecode.com/files/yard_ice-0.1.rbf Altera  Release 0.1 (RBF)]

== Hardware 0.2 ==
  * [https://yard-ice.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/fpga/release/yard_ice-0.2.rbf Altera Release 0.2 (RBF)]


= Combined Application+FPGA =

These files are single .FDU packages which combine both the YARD-ICE Application and FPGA program.

== Hardware 0.1 ==
  * [https://yard-ice.googlecode.com/svn/branches/rev0.1/src/release/yard-ice-r0.1-v0.2.22.dfu YARD-ICE-0.1 Version 0.2.22 (FDU)]

== Hardware 0.2 ==
  * [https://yard-ice.googlecode.com/svn/branches/rev0.2/src/release/yard-ice-r0.2-v0.2.22.dfu YARD-ICE-0.2 Version 0.2.22 (FDU)]

== DFU File Upgrade - How-To ==

  * Disconnect the power and USB from the YARD-ICE
  * Insert the P2 jumper in YARD-ICE board
  * Connect the USB cable
  * Run the {{{STMicroelectronics->DfuSe->DfuSe Demonstration}}}
  * The *{{{DfuSe Demo}}}* application should show {{{STM Device in DFU Mode}}} under the {{{Available DFU Devices}}}
  * Under "Upgrade or Veriy Action" press the {{{[Choose...]}}} button
  * Select the *yard-yce.dfu* firmware file. See the next section on how to create the DFU file.
  * Press the {{{[Upgrade]}}} button
  * After writing the firmware, power cycle the system without jumper P2.
