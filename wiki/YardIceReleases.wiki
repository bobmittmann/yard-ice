#summary Firmware Releases

= Introduction =

This page contains periodic firmware releases binaries.

= YARD-ICE Application =

The application should be loaded at address 0x08000000 of the flash memory.
Hardware revisions 0.1 and 0.2 share the same IO so the same firmware applies. 

= FPGA Program =

The FPGA program should be loaded at address 0x08060000 of the flash memory.
There is a difference in the pin assignments from revision 0.1 and 0.2 so two different programs should be used.
