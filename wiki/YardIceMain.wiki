= Welcome to the YARD-ICE project =

*YARD-ICE* stands for Yet Another Remote Debugger - In Circuit Emulator.

The *YARD-ICE* project is a community based, open source platform for a standalone remote debugger.

This is not a software only project. The Hardware design is free and open source as well, this includes: schematics, PCB layout and VHDL code.

One goal of the project is to free embedded systems developers from the Windows/PC platform and slow or expensive emulators. If you are a Linux or MAC user you would be able to use the tool out of the _web_. There is no need to install drivers, is all network TCP/IP based.
