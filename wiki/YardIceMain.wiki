*YARD-ICE* stands for Yet Another Remote Debugger - In Circuit Emulator.

The YARD-ICE project is a community base, open source platform for a remote debugger.

One goal of the project is to free embedded systems developers from the Windows/PC platform and slow or expensive emulators. If you are a Linux or MAC user you would be able to use the tool out of the web. There are no need to install drivers, is all network TCP/IP based.

This is not a software only project. The Hardware, including schematics, PCB layout and VHDL code for is free and open source as well.
