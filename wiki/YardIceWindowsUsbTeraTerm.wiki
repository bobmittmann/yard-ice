In order to connect your terminal to YARD-ICE through the USB port, some systems may require installing a driver provided by ST: [http://yard-ice.googlecode.com/files/stm32_vcp.zip STM32 VCOM Drivers].

The YAR-ICE implements a standard USB-CDC-ACM device. Starting from Windows XP, a generic driver is provided for this type of devices.
